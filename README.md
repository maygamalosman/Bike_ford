Dataset Overview

This project is divided into two parts:

    Data Exploration & Visualization
    In this section, I explore the various variables available in the Ford GoBike dataset. Using Python libraries and tools, I visualized and analyzed the dataset, while also conducting data wrangling.

    The exploration begins with univariate visualizations (examining each variable individually), then moves to bivariate graphs (comparing two variables), and finally, multivariate graphs (analyzing multiple variables simultaneously).

    Insights & Correlation Analysis
    The second part dives deeper into the dataset, exploring potential correlations between variables to uncover meaningful insights.

The dataset consists of 16 key features, including the main feature: trip duration, and others like:

    Start and end times
    Start and end station information (IDs, names, latitude, longitude)
    User type, birth year, gender, and whether the trip was part of the "bike share for all" program

Summary of Findings

The analysis revealed several important insights:

    Trip Duration: This key variable spans a wide range of times, from as short as 100 seconds to as long as 2000 seconds.

    Trip Timing: Most trips are concentrated during rush hours, particularly around 8 AM and 5 PM.

    Popular Stations: San Franciscoâ€™s Caltrain Station 2 and Market St 10 emerged as the busiest stations.

    User Demographics: Male subscribers make up the majority of users. However, while male users have slightly longer trip durations, the difference between male and female users is minimal.

    Age Distribution: The average user is 37 years old, but an outlier shows a user who is recorded as 144 years old.

Key Insights for Presentation

    Trip Duration: As mentioned, trip durations range from 100 to 2000 seconds.
    Rush Hours: The highest trip activity occurs at 8 AM and 5 PM.
    Station Popularity: San Francisco's Caltrain Station 2 and Market St 10 are key stations that receive a significant amount of traffic.
    Gender & Subscription Trends: Male subscribers dominate the user base, but during late-night hours, the number of customers surpasses subscribers. Despite this, subscribers show higher engagement overall.

Conclusion

The data highlights clear trends in user behavior:

    Subscribers dominate the overall user base, but customers (non-subscribers) tend to take longer trips.
    The number of customers exceeds that of subscribers during late-night hours.
    Popular stations and rush hours are critical for optimizing bike availability and station management.
